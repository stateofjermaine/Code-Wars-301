# Train Arrivals: Final Destination
You have just boarded a train when your friend texts you to ask how long it will take your train to reach the stop where they're waiting for you. Keep in mind that the returned sentence needs to follow basic grammatical rules.

# Task
Assuming that you know the distance in km and the train's average speed in km/h, let your friend know how long it will take the train to reach their stop, rounding the time to the nearest half hour. As you are sending your reply via text, you should specify the time using numbers rather than words.

Your function should return: 'The train will be there in 4 hours.'
