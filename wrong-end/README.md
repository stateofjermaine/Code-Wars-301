# My Head Is At the Wrong End
Save the animals by putting their heads and tails back to normal. Given an array with three values (tail, body, head), re-arrange the array so that the animal is the right way round (head, body, tail).

# Task
For all arrays/lists in the tests, change the element positions using the same logic.
