# Check The Exam
One input array contains the correct answers to an exam: `['a', 'a', 'b', 'd']`. The second is an "answer" array containing student answers.

The two arrays are not empty and are of equal length. 

# Task
Return the score for the array of answers, giving `+4` for each correct answer, `-1` for each incorrect answer, and `0` for each blank (empty string). If the score < 0, return 0.
